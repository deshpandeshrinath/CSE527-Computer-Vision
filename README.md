# CSE 527: Introduction to Computer Vision Fall 2017

## Abstract

Aim of this course is to gain knowledge of theory and practice in Computer Vision, and by the end will have demonstrable ability to implement a working solution for real-world problems in image and video analysis.

Github repository covers programmatic implementation of classical vision problems such as image classification, object detection and tracking, pose estimation, Structure-from-Motion, localization and mapping, deep neural networks with GPU-optimized algorithms.

[Here](CSE527-class-material/midTermNotes.md) are my class notes prepare for the
midterm.

[Here](CSE527-class-material/final_notes.md) are my class notes prepare for the
final.
